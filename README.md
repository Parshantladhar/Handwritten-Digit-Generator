# MNIST Handwritten Digits GAN

This repository contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on the MNIST Handwritten Digits dataset. The GAN is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Description

The code implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic handwritten digits. It includes data augmentation techniques and implements feature matching and spectral normalization for improved training stability.

## Usage

To run the code, you will need to have TensorFlow and Keras installed. You can install them using pip:

command: pip install tensorflow keras

Then, you can simply run the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository.

## Results

The GAN is trained for 100 epochs and generates images that closely resemble MNIST digits. You can see the generated images in the `images` folder.
